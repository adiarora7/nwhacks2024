## Project Overview
Mapcessibility is a cutting-edge application that provides personalized, accessible indoor navigation. It integrates Mappedinâ€™s innovative mapping technology into Mapbox's global map framework, offering users detailed and disability-friendly routes inside large buildings and venues. Users can input their specific accessibility needs, and the app will map out routes that accommodate these requirements, such as wheelchair-accessible paths.
